The `makepkg -si` command has successfully rebuilt and reinstalled the `ai-auto-commit` package. The build output confirms that `python-dotenv` was collected and installed during the process:

```
Collecting python-dotenv>=1.0.0
Using cached python_dotenv-1.2.1-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (25 kB)
...
Successfully installed ... python-dotenv-1.2.1 ...
```

This indicates that the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'` should now be resolved.

Please try running `autocommit` again to confirm the fix.
